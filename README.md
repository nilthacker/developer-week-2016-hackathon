# TypeMe
Swipe right with confidence with TypeMe. 

TypeMe uses machine learning to optimize your matches so you see people you like the look of, and who like the things you like. The more you swipe, the more TypeMe learns. TypeMe never shows you anyone who has already declined a match with you, so you're not wasting any time. You can rest assured that if you are seeing people you like, people who like you are seeing you too. Once you match, chat in real time or call your match--safely!--with an anonymized phone number proxy. 

Match smarter, happier, safer, with TypeMe.
